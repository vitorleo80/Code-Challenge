# Code-Challenge

Imagine we have a list of jobs, each represented by a JSON Object. Because certain jobs must be done before others, a job may have a dependency on another job. For example, a may depend on b, meaning the final sequence of jobs should place b before a. If a has no dependency, the position of a in the final sequence does not matter.
